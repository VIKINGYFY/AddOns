## Changed in v64

* Show where to tame the hidden spirit beast Aradan, for hunters only
* Profession Knowledge: adjust early points for Enchanting and Tailoring
* Show uncompleted quest status in tooltips (it was hard to tell why some points were visible otherwise if you didn't have quest IDs shown)
* Don't error when drawing an impossibly short route segment on the minimap
