## Changed in v58

* Show delves on the continent map for easier finding of bountiful delves (I also split this out into a separate addon called [DelverView](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/delverview) which is slightly better because it's not filtered through HandyNotes and so you can click the delve icons to supertrack them... but that's still waiting on Curse approval at the time I write this changelog)
