## Changed in v27

* Behavior change: count *exact* items for transmog-collection, rather than just appearance-from-any-item; previous behavior is available as a toggle in the settings
* Rearranged the settings a bunch, because they were getting to be a bit cluttered
* Fixed "open HandyNotes options" from the overlay dropdown so it properly goes all the way to the plugin's settings
