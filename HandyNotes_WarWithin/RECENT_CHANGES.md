## Changed in v32

* Show my tooltips for races on the Blizzard race POIs when enabled (in the Blizzard filters menu)
* Dornogal: Tome of Polymorph: Mosswool
* Fix non-npc non-treasure points without completion from being considered "found" always
* Mostly for myself, but just in case... you can now alt-click the map button to quickly toggle showing found points
