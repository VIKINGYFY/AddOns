## Changed in v59

* Hallowfall: improvements to the loot around the Spreading the Light area (for one: you can't see it until you have world quests)
* Show achievement-status on the continent-map delve entrances as well
* Give the delve entrances a dedicated group, because whether you want to see them is probably unrelated to whether you want to see chests inside delves
