- prep new tag

- Update localization.es.lua (#1405)  
- Update localization.fr.lua (#1406)  
- Update localization.br.lua (#1407)  
- Update localization.tw.lua (#1404)

- Update localization.ru.lua (#1402)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#1401)  
- Fix typo  
- more option clarifiction  
- more wording updates  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#1400)  
- if plater is installed, also redirect to plater options in global disables as well instead of incorrectly showing internal DBM options that'd do nothing for plater users.  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#1398)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#1399)  
- Continue culling of Trap options:  
     - Consolidated the voice pack options from 8 options down to 2, eliminating some confusion and redundancies  
     - Removed ability to disable AI timers. They should never be disabled.  
- option clearification  
- Update localization.es.lua (#1396)  
- Update koKR (#1397)  
- Removed Trap options that were meant for experienced users but constantly get toggled by users who don't know what they do.  
     - Removed ability to turn off tank filter. users too often turn this off and then get confused why they're told to taunt boss when not a tank when they disabled the option that checks spec (and was thoroughly worded as such)  
     - Removed ability to always play all voice pack sounds regardless of option settings. Again, this is a case where users clicked box then were confused when they were told to taunt, dispel, or interrupt every mechanic regardless of option settings. This option (which was very specifically worded as such) was meant for raid leaders that want to know every time a dispel or tank swap or interrupt is needed. It just didn't get used that way. it was always misused instead.  
- Update koKR (#1392)  
- Update localization.fr.lua (#1393)  
- Update localization.fr.lua (#1394)  
- Update localization.br.lua (#1395)  
- Adjust stop call on nerubar trash mod  
- Add callback and functionality to cleanup nameplate timers in absence of GUIDs such as AOE stopping all nameplate timers on a trash wipe  
- bump alpha
