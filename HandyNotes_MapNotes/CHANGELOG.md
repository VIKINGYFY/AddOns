# Handynotes: MapNotes
## https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mapnotes/files

Changelog:
• A new icon category called "Races" has been added to all tabs
• For capital cities/zones/minimaps, this is located in the "Transport" submenu
• For Azeroth/Continent maps, this is located directly there
• This category currently only contains the mole machine icons for the Dark Iron race
• It can be displayed or hidden separately on each map
• Only the icons belonging to the corresponding race are displayed (Thus, the mole machine positions are only displayed for Dark Iron dwarves)
• Once you have reached one of these locations and learned it through interaction, this icon disappears from all maps, and only the undiscovered and learned ones are displayed
• You can also display previously discovered and learned icons again under the "General" tab under "Advanced Options" under the "Race +" option
